    Most things work now. Need to find a way to get the people who tied to print. Right now, it just prints 'tie!' which is kinda lame.

    Oh em gee, I changed a lot. Now can set up votes, read votes, parse votes, and return a winner if anyone gets more than 50% of the vote. Can't count ties though. Gotta fix that. Peace~

    Added all your bs files. So many files. Why so many files. Good lord. Makes me want to punch myself in the kidney repeatedly. I don't even have this many files at work. Sheesh.
